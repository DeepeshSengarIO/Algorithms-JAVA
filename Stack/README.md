# Stack Data Structure

It is like a open lid container
Follow FIFO (First in First Out)

## Basic Operations

    push()    - Insertion Operation
    pop()     - Deletion Operation
    isEmpty() - checks if stack is empty
    peek()    - returns top of the stack
    size()    - returns size of the stack

Underflow - When pop() or peek() is called on an empty stack
overflow - when push called on a full stack
