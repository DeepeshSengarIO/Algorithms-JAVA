# Introduction

## Hashing

Hashing is mainly used to implement dictionaries where we have (key, value) pairs or only set of keys.
Unique Keys allowed only.
Hashing works best and beats other data structures when we have these 3 operations:

    1. Search       ---\
    2. Insert       ---- O(1) time average
    3. Delete       ---/

Hashing is <strong>NOT</strong> useful for:
Finding closest Value
Sorted Data
Prefix Searching
